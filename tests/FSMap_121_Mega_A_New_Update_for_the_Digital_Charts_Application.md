The latest update for FSMap, version 1.2.1 Mega, has just been released. It fixes some minor bugs and adds a new option to select the drawing library. This option solves some problems that occurred with older video cards when using Direct2D[^1^].
 
FSMap 1.2.1 Mega is compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator X and Prepar3D. It can be downloaded from the official website or from Aerosoft's online shop.

FSMap is more than just a digital charts application. It also offers a variety of features that enhance the flight simulation experience. For example, it can display the aircraft position and flight plan on the map, as well as the weather, traffic and airspace information. It can also connect to online networks such as VATSIM and IVAO, and show the online controllers and pilots on the map.
 
Another feature of FSMap is the ability to add more charts to the application. Users can create their own charts using the integrated chart editor and configurator, or download charts from other sources. FSMap supports various formats such as GeoTIFF, JPG, PNG and BMP. Users can also customize the appearance and behavior of the charts using XML files.
 
One of the improvements in FSMap 1.2.1 Mega is the option to select the drawing library. The drawing library is responsible for rendering the charts on the screen. FSMap offers two options: GDI+ and Direct2D. GDI+ is the default option that works with most video cards, but it has some limitations in terms of performance and quality. Direct2D is a newer option that uses hardware acceleration and provides smoother graphics and better anti-aliasing. However, it requires a compatible video card and driver. Some older video cards may not support Direct2D or may cause errors when using it. The new option allows users to choose the best option for their system.

To switch between GDI+ and Direct2D, users need to open the FSMap settings window and go to the Display tab. There they can find a drop-down menu that allows them to choose the drawing library. After selecting the desired option, they need to restart FSMap for the changes to take effect.
 
There are many sources for downloading more charts for FSMap. One of them is the official website of FSMap, where users can find a section called "Chart Downloads". There they can find links to various websites that offer free or paid charts for different regions and countries. Another source is the Aerosoft forum, where users can share their own charts or request charts from other users. Users can also search the internet for other websites that provide charts for FSMap.
